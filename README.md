# Ubuntu Server

## What's this about?ðŸ¤”
God knows how many weeks It took me to successfully set up my mailserver, such that Gmail did not think it was Spam.

## Duh... So why a repo?ðŸ™„
 I'll *kuku* keep it here, so I don't have to search the whole world next time I'm setting up another mail Server.

## So this is all just for a mail ServerðŸ˜•
Then I thought, why don't I just keep everything here, whether mail or not. As long as it's server related.
